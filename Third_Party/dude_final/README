1. usage:

Usage: ./dude2d [options] P.poly -svg
options:

-g              disable openGL visualization
-o file         dump decompoisition to file
-ske            build skeleton after decomposition
-ps             saves to ps file
-pske           save skeleton ps file
-pp             saves polygon pieces to ps file
-j              convert to json file
-k [value]      create k-number of decomposition
-tau [value]    tolerable concavity
-com [file.txt] to compare the segmenation with a segmentation from file
-ite            decompse once
-polys          export decomposed polygons into files
-svg            render decomposed polygons into svg files

Two examples in folder examples/. The .svg file can be viewed using browser.
 
 ./dude2d examples/bike.poly -svg
 ./dude2d examples/airplant.poly -svg

some sample polygon data can be found in http://masc.cs.gmu.edu/wiki/Software#dude2d


2. compile

  2.1 dependency
  required:  CGAL
  optional: OpenGL

  2.2 compiling options
  The default of OpenGL rendering has been turned off.
  
  compiling options: in compile_option.h, the OpenGL and pslib can be turned on using the following setting:
   
   #define GL_RENDERING 1 //openGL rendering
   #define PS_RENDERING 1 //postscript rendering

  2.3 linux
  The code has been compiled on Linux and OSX. To compile code, go the home direction which contains Makefile, Makefile_nogl.

   a. when OpenGL is not installed and compiling option has been turned off:
   make

   b. when OpenGL is installed and compiling option has been turned on:
   make -f Makefile_gl

  2.4 windows
  A visual studio 2013 solution file has been included. You may need to project settings(include, lib) accordingly for the cases including OpenGL/not including OpenGL.
